# Joystream Working Groups Bot

Discord Bot which informs Joystream DAO on Discord about the important events related to working groups: new openings, salary changes, hires, fires, applications etc. Built in Node.js.

This version is compatible with Rhodes network, but wasn't tested with Ephesus one.

# Roadmap

How would this product evolve depends chiefly on the demand from the DAO. However, it seems reasonable to add the following features:

1. Interactive slash commands (`/salary` to see my salary, `/earnings` to get earnings for last X days, etc.) ONLY YOUR IMAGINATION IS THE LIMIT HERE :) 
2. Show "before/after" state for Salary and Stake events
3. Add a clickable link to apply on an opening


# Configuration

The main configuration file is `../../config.ts`. Here, the mapping between the Working Groups and Discord channels is kept. You may map several Working Groups to a single channnel, or have each Working Group notifications sent to a dedicated channel, depending on your needs. Make sure your bot has appropriate permissions to channels you configured in `../../config.ts`. 

The configuration for code generator is in `../../codegen.yml`. 

# Installation

Download external libraries with `npm i`

As the project uses autogenerated code, you must execute `npm run generate` that produces `../src/qntypes.ts` file.
